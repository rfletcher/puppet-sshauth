# = Define: sshauth::key::client
#
# Install a key pair into a user's account.
#
# This definition is private, i.e. it is not intended to be called directly by
# users. Called by sshauth::key to generate an exported resource and by
# sshauth::client to realize the resource tagged by namevar (the keyname).
#
# === Parameters: see sshauth::client
#
# === Usage:
#
# # from sshauth::key
# @@sshauth::key::client { $name:
#     ensure   => $ensure,
#     filename => $_filename,
#     user     => $_user,
#     tag      => $_tag,
# }

# # from sshauth::client
# Sshauth::Key::Client <<| tag == $_tag |>>
